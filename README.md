# Metacritic Game Review Sentiment Analysis
What makes a good RPG game appealing to a gamer? What did gamers enjoy and dislike the most in other game genres on the Xbox One, Playstation 4 and Nintendo Switch consoles? With the next generation version of these consoles on the rise, in this project I aimed to conduct sentiment analysis on game reviews scraped off Metacritic and considered two business cases where the model may be useful.
